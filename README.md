"I have created a form validation system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code. The form includes various input fields, such as name, email, password, and more, with validation checks to ensure proper data entry. JavaScript is used to handle real-time validation, providing error messages for incorrect inputs and preventing form submission until all fields meet the required criteria. CSS is used to style the form and display validation messages effectively. This project improves user experience by ensuring accurate data submission and reducing errors."
